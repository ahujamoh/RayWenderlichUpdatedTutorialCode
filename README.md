Learning step by step from RayWenderlich's website in Xcode 6.1 IDE

  While I learned ios from [Ray's](http://www.raywenderlich.com/tutorials) website step by step according to their great tutorials, I found my development environment was a little different from the tutorial's, especially for Xcode 6.1. So I tried to follow their steps in Xcode 6.1 and this respository will be used to record my study curves.
