================================

Learning step by step from RayWenderlich's website in new version of Xcode.

  While I learned ios from [Ray's][1] website step by step according to their great tutorials, I found my development environment was a little different from the tutorial's, especially for Xcode 6.1. So I tried to follow their steps in new Xcode and this respository will be used to record my study curves.
